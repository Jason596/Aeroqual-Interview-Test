# Aeroqual Cloud Developer test

This test is to create a simple API that serves data from a json file.

The JSON file is data.json, and contains a list of people, with their names and ages.

We would like you to create a RESTful API that allows you to create, update, delete, and get people.

In addition, we would like to be able to search by a person's name. The input may not always be a complete name, e.g. if the input is "hat", we expect "hat", "hatter", "that" etc to be returned.

You are free to layout the project however you wish. 

We would like to see what you would consider production quality code.

Please commit your code to a private github repository and share it with maxgruebneraeroqual.

If you cannot do that for some reason, please zip the source code and email it to the recruiter.

If you have made any design decisions that you would like to explain please add them to this file.
